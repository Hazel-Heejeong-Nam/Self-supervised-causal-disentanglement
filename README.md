# Self supervised causal disentanglement through generative models

This project is an ongoing project as part of an individual graduation project in Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea. 

Our model aims to learn causality without any priori or inductive bias. This has two main compositions: Observer and interpreter.

- Observer for the model is written based on Beta-VAE from Higgins et al., pytorch-implementation from
